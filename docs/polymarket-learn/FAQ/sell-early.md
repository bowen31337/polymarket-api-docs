# Can I Sell Early?

**Yes, you can sell or close your position early.**

You may sell shares at any point before the market is resolved by either placing a market order to sell shares at the prevailing bid price in the orderbook, or by placing a limit order for how many shares you wish to sell and at what price.

The limit order will only be executed if/when there is a willing buyer for your shares at the price you set.
