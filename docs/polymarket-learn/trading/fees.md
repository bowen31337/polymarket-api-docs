# Trading Fees

Polymarket does not charge fees on most markets. However, **15-minute crypto markets** have taker fees enabled to fund the [Maker Rebates Program](/polymarket-learn/trading/maker-rebates-program).

## Fee-Free Markets

The vast majority of Polymarket markets have **no trading fees**:

* No fees to deposit or withdraw USDC (though intermediaries like Coinbase or MoonPay may charge their own fees)
* No fees to trade shares

## Markets With Fees

**15-minute crypto markets** charge a small taker fee on each trade. These fees are collected and redistributed daily to market makers as rebates, incentivizing deeper liquidity and tighter spreads.
