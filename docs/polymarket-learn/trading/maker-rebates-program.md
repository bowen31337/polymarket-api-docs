# Maker Rebates Program

We're rolling out **Maker Rebates** for **15-minute crypto markets**; a program designed to make these fast-moving markets deeper, tighter, and easier to trade.

Market makers who provide **active liquidity** (orders that get filled) earn **daily USDC rebates**, proportional to the liquidity they provide.

## Why Maker Rebates?

15-minute markets move quickly. When liquidity is deeper:

* Spreads tend to be tighter
* Price impact is lower
* Fills are more reliable
* Markets are more resilient during volatility

Maker Rebates incentivize **consistent, competitive quoting** so everyone gets a better trading experience.

## How Maker Rebates Work

* **Paid daily in USDC:** Rebates are calculated and distributed every day.
* **Performance-based:** You earn based on the share of liquidity you provided that actually got taken.

### Funding

Maker Rebates are funded by **taker fees collected in 15-minute crypto markets**. A percentage of these fees are redistributed to makers who keep the markets liquid.

| Period                                           | Maker Rebate | Distribution Method |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Jan 9 – Jan 11, 2026 (Until Sunday Midnight UTC) | 100%         | Volume-weighted     |
| Jan 12 – Jan 18, 2026                            | 20%          | Volume-weighted     |
| Jan 19+                                          | 20%          | Fee-curve weighted  |

<Note>
  Polymarket collects taker fees **only** in 15-minute crypto markets. The rebate percentage is at the sole discretion of Polymarket and may change over time.
</Note>

## Fee-Curve Weighted Rebates

Rebates are distributed using the **same formula as taker fees**. This ensures makers are rewarded proportionally to the fee value their liquidity generates.

For each filled maker order:

```text  theme={null}
fee_equivalent = shares * price * 0.25 * (price * (1 - price))^2
```

Your daily rebate:

```text  theme={null}
rebate = (your_fee_equivalent / total_fee_equivalent) * rebate_pool
```

## Taker Fee Structure

Taker fees are calculated in USDC and vary based on the share price. Fees are **highest at 50%** probability and **lowest at the extremes** (near 0% or 100%).

The maximum effective fee rate is **1.56%** at 50% probability. Fees decrease symmetrically toward both extremes.

### Fee Precision

Fees are rounded to 4 decimal places. The smallest fee charged is **0.0001 USDC**. Anything smaller rounds to zero, so very small trades near the extremes may incur no fee at all.
