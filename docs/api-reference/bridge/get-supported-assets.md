# Get supported assets

> Retrieve all supported chains and tokens for deposits and withdrawals.

**USDC.e on Polygon:**
Polymarket uses USDC.e (Bridged USDC from Ethereum) on Polygon as the native collateral for all markets. When you deposit assets from other chains, they are automatically bridged and swapped to USDC.e on Polygon. When you withdraw, your USDC.e is bridged and swapped to your desired token on the destination chain.

**Minimum Amounts:**
Each asset has a `minCheckoutUsd` field indicating the minimum amount required in USD. Make sure your deposit or withdrawal meets this minimum to avoid transaction failures.
